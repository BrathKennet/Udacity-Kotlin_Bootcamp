/*
* Let's improve our SimpleSpice class so that we can have various spices with different levels of spiciness.
* Create a new class, Spice.
* Pass in a mandatory String argument for the name,
* and a String argument for the level of spiciness where the default value is mild for not spicy.
* Add a variable, heat, to your class, with a getter that returns a numeric value for each type of spiciness.
* Instead of the list of spices as Strings you used earlier,
* create a list of Spice objects and give each object a name and a spiciness level.
* Add an init block that prints out the values for the object after it has been created. Create a spice.
* Create a list of spices that are spicy or less than spicy. Hint: Use a filter and the heat property.
* Because salt is a very common spice, create a helper function called makeSalt().
